        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Whenever people ask for my social media profiles links, my personal emails, or this very website's URL, I often get a see a very typical smirk and the question "Why are you <em>hackpert</em> ?" My usual answer is "My sixth grade self thought that it was cool, and the username stuck", but the story is in fact quite a bit deeper.</p>

<p>In March 2007, I had just completed the fourth grade and had little to do, having finished every book I could lay my hands on at home (except <em>Far from the Madding Crowd</em> by Thomas Hardy, of which I couldn't bear more than ten pages). I was already into computers quite a bit by that time, and one fine day, drowning in the highly treacherous Gulf of Boredom, I decided to venture into some sketchy parts of networking and the internet. The knowledge per se wasn't sketchy, and in fact formed a strong foundation of computer networking fundamentals in my mind, but the sources where the sentence <em>For educational purposes only</em> graced the top of every post certainly were. Like most people I started out by trying things out on my own system and attempted to find vulnerabilities. </p>

<p>And <em>boy</em> were there some and more. My computer network wasn't so much of a wall as it was a shredded, moth-infested patchwork curtain that allowed a full view of whatever nefarious activities were going on behind. Okay, I didn't set it up myself and it barely had two functioning machines but the pathetic security provided by an ancient version of Norton Antivirus that I was <em>so</em> fond of meant that a pesky Trojan could potentially have transmitted everything I was doing to a remote location. And it did. Not just mine, but for approximately 50,000 computers in Delhi that were on MTNL's network and running antiquated Windows versions. W00t, it was the first vulnerability I found on my own (or didn't, since it was already documented). Anyway I reported that to MTNL and was lauded for the effort. I suspect they patched it after a millennium or so.  </p>

<p>First successes often give kids a lot of confidence, and by virtue of the Dunning Kruger effect, I suspect I was somewhere near the first 'confidence peak'. <br>

<p>As luck had it, I decided to start a blog to show off my newfound ethical 'hacking' skills. I started writing some tutorials on setting up sort-of secure networks and finding vulnerabilities in Windows machines, thereby documenting my own tales. Slowly I got introduced to the Linux scene and started playing around with distros, and around the same time, I started getting actual <strong>visits</strong> to my blog! I found that absolutely crazy. But I thought instead of gloating about runaway success, why don't I monetize it? The blog would surely get me a lot of Cheetos Pokémon Tazos.</p>

<p>Now since I had the opinion that everything I was doing was shady because of the "H-word", I kept all of this hidden from my family. I discreetly set up Google Adsense on the blog, but it required a bank account number, something I didn't have. My email account, that someone generously gave me when Gmail invites were the most precious commodity on the market, was typically accessed by everyone who needed to use it, so I couldn't use PayPal on it either. So in the spur of the moment, I created a new Gmail account under a pseudonym. I thought it would be cool if it reflected what I did with it, so I came up with the portmanteau of <strong>hacker</strong> + <strong>expert</strong> = <strong>hackpert</strong> and signed up on PayPal. I did manage to earn about 21$ over a couple of months. 1000 rupees meant 100 tazos! I was a <em>tazollionaire</em>! I never got around to withdrawing that money though and I suspect it still lurks in that PayPal account. Over time I got interested in other stuff like writing programs to cheat on online games, but the name stuck. And lo, <em>hackpert</em> I was.</p>

<p>P.S. I had no idea the word 'pert' existed then and the connection to 'expert' was so obvious to me that I didn't even pause to ponder. It was only years later that I found out, but by then the monicker had long become part of my online identity. </p>
