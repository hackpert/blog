            <p>So here I am with another blog, started in the middle of 2016. I bet the question on most minds is <em>Why bother?</em>  Well at least it is on mine, so I'm going to answer it anyway.</p>

<h3 id="whythisblog">Why this blog?</h3>

<p>About four years ago I was the usual nerd you'd find flocking the front desk in every classroom around the world, with a dash of typical nerdy hobbies like reading, quizzing, coding etc. I gradually underwent a tremendous transformation from a typical nerd to a maker (more like a <em>wannabe maker</em>). The turning point for me was the realization that not only could I do what I was interested in for the rest of my life, but actually get <em>good</em> at making and make an impact through my work. </p>

<p>While this might seem trivial to most readers, this realization defines what I do today and is the ethos of this blog. I aim to induct more people into the maker culture and let others know about what I'm doing through it.</p>

<h3 id="whatisitabout">What is it about?</h3>

<p>Enough about the background story already, right? This blog, as the description states, is going to be all about the science and art of <strong>making</strong>. </p>

<p>Now, what exactly constitutes making in this context? Absolutely everything. My posts are going to cover a wide range of topics ranging from perhaps a new paper in statistical physics to a some new electronics or science project I undertake. As evident from the the name, a lot of my posts are going to be about or use computers, but my thoughts and ideas certainly go beyond. </p>

<p>There is one thing I promise, though. None of my posts will be boring if you read them with the right outlook.  </p>

<h3 id="whyghost">Why Ghost?</h3>

<p>There are a ton of blogging platforms to choose from. Why in the world did I choose a rather cumbersome to set up platform? Here are a few reasons which might make sense</p>

<ul>
<li>Markdown ♥️. Impeccable markdown support with a beautiful interface is one of the prime reasons I chose Ghost over others.</li>
<li>Ghost is beautiful. Not much to say about that.</li>
<li>Offline editing. Right now I edit the blog offline, check that everything works, and then push it to Github Pages with <a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster">buster</a>. It's so much more convenient.</li>
<li><code>It's convenient for code.</code> Since a lot my content is going to involve computer science, it is inevitable that some code will creep in.</li>
<li>Markdown yet again. And I can write and edit my posts on my Kindle Paperwhite. Who even edits stuff on Kindle? I do. (I think I'll write a post on doing nice stuff on Kindle later)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="whoareyouanyway">Who are you anyway?</h3>

<p>Well if you've stuck around till now without knowing this, thank you! This question, almost trivial for most people, is incredibly hard for me to answer.</p>

<p>I am Saarthak, an 18 year old wannabe maker. People often associate where they live or where they went to school with their identities, but honestly I don't deem those important enough to let them define me. Who am I? I am who I am, and I won't tell you because I want to let you form your own opinion. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading my ramblings! Here's a cat GIF for you. <br>
